# AI Vision

This is a shared repository between [Rissalat Ahmed](https://github.com/rkapdi) and [Saniya Nafees](https://github.com/saniyanafees6). Our goal here is to create a fullstack web application with payment integration. 

## Our Idea
*more stuff to come*
* User uploads the image
* We generate an image caption, which becomes an input to GPT2
* GPT2 generates text based on the input received from the image caption
